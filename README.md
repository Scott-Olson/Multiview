## ðŸš€ About This Project

This project was designed and built for a MEAN Stack Hackathon during my time at the Coding Dojo Bootcamp.

The intent of the project at the time was to allow users to watch multiple Twitch streams at the same time such that if two, three, or four streamers were on a team
and streaming the same game, you would be able to see that game from all perspectives at once. 

Not only was it a fun and challenging project, after my implementation was complete, Twitch implemented this feature natively on their platform. Now I don't claim ownership of the idea,
but I do think I came up with a better name!

### Example Usage
This is a screenshot of the website in use to watch multiple streamers play the popular PlayerUnkown Battlegrounds in a tournament.
